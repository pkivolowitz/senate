# February 12 Senate meeting

As best as I can manage:

* move to zero based budgeting - all dollars must be justified
* a number of minutes were approved (senate and faculty) senate can approve minutes of faculty if not already approved
* minutes will be on line along with the audio recording
* 21-22 ay ought to be a balanced budgeting
* congrats to new tenured professors (and sabbatical approvees)
* dca courses accepted
* division meeting will use some time for all faculty / staff meeting
* at board meeting student gave student body presentation - nice anecdote - the faculty is the best thing at Carthage
* geoc update - one hour meeting - they worked on their timeline and hope to have it ready to roll out soon - will have a document archive
  * subcommittees meeting within the next two weeks to work on processes and templates hopefully arriving at one template across campus
  * soliciting questions from faculty - happy to answer
  ed k - what is the resolution path if there is disagreement about designation - no answer yet
  first year foundations committee has no representative on geoc yet - asked for copies of geoc reports
task force for team names and mascots - fill out your survey!
  * They have met to research / decide process to go forward
  * Next meeting set down what questions they are to decide (as a result of the process)
  * Tens of thousands of surveys sent / being sent
    1. is the team name unifying
    2. does it represent positive values
    3. is it relevant
    4. is it representative of Carthage
    5. can it be used by different genders
    6. can it be rendered pleasingly
  * May meeting of board to decide IF name / mascot is to change
* brian - there was a motion to revamp curriculum approval process...
  * brian has reworked the previous motion
  * goal to have single layer of substantive deliberation
  * observe at division meeting courses may be discussed but "nothing changes" - division as a body not equipped to deliberate as intended
  * proposal says divisions don't have to deliberate
  * dcc will do that
  * cca will facilitate process as a whole - communication across committees / silos - encourage uniformity between the divisions - send final packages off to the registrar and report to senate
  * deans will have more reporting responsibility / transparency
  * emphasis on requirement for documentation of processes
  * summary - course related votes from 4 to 2
* discussion about size of senate - there may be a motion to decrease the size of the senate but increasing the requirement for diversity across campus
* broached discussion about determining when a course is low enrolled as some low enrolling courses are required courses
  * provost acknowledged the differing requirements / obigations in the divisions
  * provost acknowledged that low enrolling course decisions are made very late
  * this is early in the discussion process
  * deanna added dean's perspective - keep track of past to set expectations for future
